Introduction:\
Introducing AvatarFusion,  aim is to enhance human-machine interaction and create a more engaging conversation experience. In addition to conversation, 3D avatars can enhance the attractiveness of
chatbots and effectively display emotions through facial expressions, making the
conversation more engaging. Facial expressions play a crucial role in non-verbal
communication,without the need for words. Facial expressions are not exclusive to humans but also
observed in animals, where they serve as a means of defense or offense. For example, a
dog may exhibit an angry face while barking to deter potential threats without physical
contact. This chatbot enhances interaction through facial expressions. Research suggests
that interactive animated characters can benefit individuals with social difficulties. The
chatbots instructions become clearer, and users feel like they are interacting with a human rather than a bot.
